# Identification of Sagittarius stream members in Angular Momentum with Gaussian mixture techniques
## Pe√±arrubia & Petersen, 2021 (PP21)

This repository hosts a data file with the Sagittarius stream membership probabilities for a sample of halo stars. We also provide a very simple Jupyter Notebook example for how to interface with the data.

We also provide the posterior chains from the fit process.
